* Short
Dad was extremely intelligent and hard working. The would be Renaissance man, dad had a hunger for learning in so many areas of arts and science. He taught me about the atom and DNA in elementary school. He attended Astronomy club for years. He used to test me on the birthdays of Shakespeare, Bach and Beethoven and initiate discussions about pianists will riding SEPTA. He was a goofball. He almost fell over laughing relating the plot of Woody Allan's Bananas. We used to throw the ball back and forth. We used to ride our bikes on the "circuit". Dad gave up meat, cheese, eggs and was the picture of health. He made us watch shock animal rights videos on his birthday. It was uncomfortable but I had to acknowledge the facts. He resumed the violin after 60 years. We played duets. He had a checkered history with women, but finally there was Asako. He actually loved her. Our performance of Albinoni's Adagio was a train wreck, but it was also amazing. When Asako had her stroke, then heart valve replacements, then another heart valve replacement, then more strokes, He cared for her and showed her Christ-like love. He thought deeply about the cosmos. I loved listening to him talk about quantum mechanics. I loved going to concerts with him. I loved being with him. He was a great dad.

* Dear Dad

You were a great dad. I remember when you would ask me to make my tiger sound and I would do it and you'd tell me how real it sounded. I remember going to Roy Rogers with you and you smoking in the car and spitting out the window. I remember when I was telling you that what I learned in Sunday school, that Zacchaeus climbed the tree and the teacher said, "And Jesus said, Zacchaeus, get down from that stupid tree", and you said, "Jesus didn't say 'stupid'" and I assured you with maximum certainty that he did in fact say "stupid" tree. I remember when we used to ride the train into Philly and you taught me, "Do not Store up your treasure in heaven where moth and rust doth corrupt and thieves break in and steal, but store up your treasure in heaven where moth and rust doth not corrupt and thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."

I remember when you helped Billy Stoneberg and I build a simple electricity experiment with a 6 volt batters a flashlight bulb, a double throw switch, some copper wire and some nails. I remember how mad you got when I was enrolled in Phil-Mont Christian Academy. I remember when you taught me not to use the word "get", but to use more descriptive verbs in speaking and writing. I remember our bike trip to Mt. Vernon from the hotel in Washington DC. I felt so proud when we arrived at Mt. Vernon, then I crashed on the way back. I remember you pottering in the kitchen while I worked on poster boards drawing the space shuttle for visual aids to my school report. Peter Gabriel was on the stereo.

Peter Gabriel was also on the radio when you were attempting to drive on the left side of the road in England when I was 14 years old. We visited a majority of Cathedrals in southern England. I was so embarrassed by you in the pub with your map open and talking so loud. I felt like everyone else was watching us. You were so patient with me when you were embarrassed by me picking up a British accent. I remember walking around Stonehenge with you. I remember trying to live with you in college. It didn't work out that well, mainly because you told me I needed to clean my room. I remember year after year explaining to you how the world really was at Taco Bell and you telling me that I was much farther along than you were at my age. That was false.

I remember watching the NBA finals with Michael Jordan in Marge's cottage on Penobscot Bay in Maine. I remember climbing half way up to Mt. Katadhin and the Thunder hole at Acadia, seeing a moose and the top of Mt. Washington. I remember the wild horses at Chinquitigue Isleand and the horse flies. I remember sitting next to you as you explained to me that when the user hovers over the little picture of the farm on the map of NJ, the farm needs to light up and the name and address of the farm need to appear in the box. We did it together in Adobe Photoshop. You kicked my butt in tennis when I was 25 and you were 75, and I wasn't terrible at tennis. We used to throw the ball back and forth. We used to ride our bikes on the "circuit".

There was Marge, Jaqui, another lady from the Animal Rights group, then finally Asako. You actually loved her. Our performance of Albinoni's Adagio was a train wreck, but it was also amazing. We played duets on the violin. I remember sitting in the car with you and we listened to the entire CD of Bach Violin Sonata's played by Hilary Hahn. There was that magical season of concerts at the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia led by Ignat Solschenitzen. All the Brandenburg Concertos, the Barber Viola concerto performed by Yuri Bashmet and the Moscow Chamber Orchestra, The Double Concerto. We saw the Venice Baroque Orchestra play Vivaldi's Four Seasons, with Giuliano Carmengnola leading. I learned to play the recorder at your place because you volunteered with the Philomel Baroque Orchestra.

How many conversations did we have about religion? Hundreds. I used every trick in the book, which is not the right way, but also learned some humility and shared what God as done for Me. You would have none of it. There was only contempt and bitterness. You came to church with me a few times and had so many questions for the pastor. You always had them going. In your last days you were to weak and you had to listen. When Asako had her stroke, then heart valve replacements, then another heart valve replacement, then more strokes, you showed her the care, love and patience that God intends us to show. I told you one time that to me it was a prime example and Christ like sacrificial love. You said it wasn't a sacrifice. How God uses these hardships in our lives to grow us. She would say "Carl! Hello... hello...!" She became a bit ornery in her decline much as you did. I remember saying goodbye to Asako. You were crushed. You actually loved her in a way you never loved before. I remember going to the farmers market and the bar at Pastabilities in Greensboro where Lee would flirt with the bar maid who was young enough to be his daughter and possibly grand-daughter. I remember you trying to get me to see that I had what it takes to get a professional job with computers, but I was blocked. I remember when you and I and Dan and Tim Lewis watched the Eagles win the super bowl at the hotel lobby in Tuscon. I remember when you met Julia in Greensboro this past summer.

I remember walking into the hospital room and seeing you in the hospital gown, sedated, with your mouth open as with rigormortis, with protective mits. I held your hand and held by phone to your ear: Mozart, Bach, Puccini, Handel. You started to get a foothold on reality. The next day you realized that Jelyne and Julia were there with me, and you smiled. Hospice was comfortable and peaceful. They gave you a nice shave and trimmed your mustache, but left a bit more handle than you ever did. Your hair was also longer than you ever kept it and somewhat slicked back. As you lost weight and your cheeks sunk in, you looked like a real guido, but graceful and handsome. Ice chips became your staple. They fed you pureed peas and carrots, jello, oatmeal. You'd take a bit, then make the most contorted, disgusted expression. Back to ice chips. You would try to speak, but nothing would come out and you would rest and try again. Again and again until you'd finally get a word or two out, or maybe a phrase. I remember working on my laptop while you slept peacefully. I remember when you became too weak to cough and clear the fluid from your wind pipe. You tried to speak, but there was only the sound of gurgling. You rested and gave up trying, but not with frustration. How I cried for you that night. I remember the labor of your breathing, and the alarming pauses. I remember Jelyne calling me in while I was out of the room on the phone with Ceci. He had closed his mouth a couple of times. I remember watching his chest move up and down, up and down, and then stop. I remember how he looked in the bed with his arms peacefully crossed.

To Add: shoes and telling him no more shoes. All the support and the family coming together. Astronomy club: listening to U2 at the schukill center. Earth day, winning the star map. Listening to the 1812 overture on his stereo. Reading books about sub-atomic particles, cells, DNA. Testing me on the 3 B's, Johann Sebastian Front, the four fathers of the church, the birthdates and deathdates of Shakespeare, Bach, Beethoven. On the train, he said let's talk about pianists, but I heard him incorrectly and we had a great laugh. Going into his room before bedtime and lying next to him while he sat up reading. Watching him fold laundry, pants into thirds. He would take me to rollerskating practice. The cloisters in Manhattan. Christmas days: with lots of family, then just the two of us, eating lunch at Aldo Lamerti's and catching a movie at the Ritz, him telling me some lady from the animal rights group wasn't talking to him anymore because he asked her to sleep with him; merry Christmas to you too. Him telling me about the courses he was taking at MCCC. Trying to remember the circle of fifths.
